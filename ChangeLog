	* tcl/xorb-deployment-procs.tcl: Added a more robust/ generic
          deployment variant for contracts and implementations. Now,
          both contracts and implementations have to be explicitly
          deployed (calling 'deploy' on their specification
          objects). Behind the scene, it will, depending on the
          runtime context (intialisation, running instance) either be
          lazily or instantly synchronised etc. This changes allows to
          inject contracts and implementations from different
          contexts, i.e. the developer shell or a web-ui script.

	* tcl/20-xorb-procs.tcl: Started rewriting the the
          request-broker kernel to make use of the generic OpenACS
          Object System support that comes with
          0.4. ::xorb::ServiceContract and
          ::xorb::ServiceImplementation are partly completed.

	* sql/postgresql/xotcl-request-broker-create.sql: There is a
          new constructor procedure and extension table for elements
          to message types in service contracts (constructor:
          xorb_msg_type_element__new, table:
          xorb_msg_type_elements_ext). They allow for extending the
          information model of message type elements independently
          from the basic message type elements
          (e.g. element_constraints). As message type elements are not
          designed as acs_objects, it is somehow hacky. We plan to TIP
          the amendment of acs-service-contract schema in this manner.

	* sql/postgresql/acs-object-model-function-args.sql: Adding
          generic upgrade script to register a set of plpgsql stored
          procedures related to the ACS Object System with with
          xotcl-core's DB abstraction layer (::xo::db::sql::*). This
          has, at this point in time, not committed to any version in
          the OpenACS code base. The upgrade therefore applies to all
          supported OpenACS versions.

	* sql/postgresql/acs-service-contract-function-args.sql:
          Adding generic upgrade script to register a set of pgplsql
          stored procedures with xotcl-core's DB abstraction layer
          (::xo::db::sql::*). In acs-service-contract => 5.4.0d1, they
          are integrated with the released package.

	* tcl/xorb-callback-procs.tcl: Added initial callback support
	  for XORB. It will handle upgrade and install refinements
	  starting with release version 0.4.

	* tcl/15-xorb-aux-procs.tcl: Completed the basic set of a XORB
	  framework support for the OpenACS Object System:
	  ::xorb::AcsObjectType and ::xorb::AcsAttribute allows for
	  the management of acs_object_types, ::xorb::AcsObject is the
	  base class for XOTcl representations of acs_objects. The
	  facilities are integrated with the xotcl-core DB abstraction
	  layer (::xo::db::sql::*).
	
	* ChangeLog: Added this ChangeLog to the repository.
