===================================

1)------------------------------------------
	At this point, I assume that you have successfully
	installed the xorb OpenACS package, following
	the standard OpenACS APM procedures.

2)------------------------------------------
	In its current version, it is necessary to patch the
	xotcl-core package. You find the set of patches in
	www/doc/patches. There are currently two, simply
	apply them by executing:

	(xotcl-core-blueprint.patch --- CRITICAL)
	# cd <your_instance>/packages/xotcl-core
	# patch -p0 < xotcl-core-blueprint.patch

	(xotcl-core-http-chunked.patch --- MEDIUM)
	# cd <your_aolserver>/lib/<your_xotcl>
	# patch -p0 < xotcl-core-http-chunked.patch

	(xotcl-core-serializer.patch --- CRITICAL for xotcl <1.5)
	# cd <your_aolserver>/lib/<your_xotcl>
	# patch -p0 < xotcl-core-serializer.patch

3)------------------------------------------
	At this point, you have successfully installed xorb.
	No need for further efforts ...
